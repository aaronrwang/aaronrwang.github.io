It introduces fundamental concepts and principles of computer science, from formulating a problem and analyzing it conceptually, to designing, implementing, and testing a program on a computer. Using data and procedural abstractions as basic design principles for programs, students learn to define basic data structures, such as lists and trees, and to apply various algorithms for operating on them. The course also introduces object-oriented methods.'

This course will focus these topics on design and use of elementary data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, and trees, as well as advanced techniques such as divide-and-conquer, sorting, searching and graph algorithms. More advanced data structures such as priority queues and search trees will also be covered.'
