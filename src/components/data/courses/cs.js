After completing the course, you will be able to write programs that manipulate computer languages in different ways, ranging from simple interactive calculators to programs that translate one language to another. Students completing the course may also experience some side effects: (1) You will learn how to use pointers really well. (2) You will gain experience in engineering a complex piece of software including revision control, testing, and evolution. (3) You will understand the C language inside and out, which will make you a better programmer all around.'
